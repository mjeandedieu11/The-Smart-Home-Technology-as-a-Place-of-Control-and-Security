# The-Smart-Home-Technology-as-a-Place-of-Control-and-Security
This project is designed to create a smart home system that provides control and security for homeowners. The system utilizes Proteus, Python, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi technologies to create an integrated system that can be controlled remotely and utilizes face recognition technology to ensure security.

Features
Control of lighting, heating, and cooling systems
Remote control of security cameras and alarms
Integration with smart home devices like Amazon Alexa and Google Home
Real-time monitoring of energy usage and cost
Facial recognition for enhanced security
Technologies Used
Proteus for designing and simulating electronic circuits
Arduino microcontrollers for controlling sensors and actuators
Raspberry Pi for facial recognition
Python for programming the main control system and facial recognition
MQTT protocol for communication between devices
AWS IoT Core for securely connecting to the internet and controlling devices remotely
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Proteus and the required libraries.
Connect the Arduino board to your computer and upload the firmware.
Install the necessary Python packages using pip.
Set up an AWS IoT Core account and configure your device certificates and security policies.
Install OpenCV and the necessary Python packages for facial recognition on the Raspberry Pi.
Run the Python script to start the main control system and facial recognition.
